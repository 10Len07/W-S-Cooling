## Project summary

### The issue we are hoping to solve

Solve the problems of environmental damage caused by solar panel installation and thermal damage to crops through W-S Cooling

### How our technology solution can help

Watson Studio optimizes W-S Cooling for spray cooling at the right time

### Our idea

W-S Cooling is a PV-Wind hybrid system installed in farms that integrates a misting system. It utilizes MOFs material to absorb moisture from the air, and then transfers the waste heat from the solar panels through a thermal tube to the MOFs, causing it to evaporate and obtain water that is used by the misting system to cool down the crops and reduce heat damage. 
The Watson Studio service optimizes W-S Cooling's spray cooling at the correct temperature and time. Visual charts present data such as wind speed and wind volume, and turn the wind turbine to a strong wind location to optimize power generation.

## Technology implementation

### IBM AI service(s) used

- [Watson Studio](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-studio) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION

The Watson Studio service optimizes W-S Cooling's spray cooling at the correct temperature and time. Visual charts present data such as wind speed and wind volume, and turn the wind turbine to a strong wind location to optimize power generation.

### Other IBM technology used

Through the VPC virtual server, W-S Cooling can establish a database to view the temperature, humidity, wind speed and other values ​​in the area, thereby optimizing W-S Cooling operations and maximizing the benefits of cooling and power generation.

### Solution architecture

There are two W-S Cooling backend and cloud data technologies:

1. The Watson Studio service optimizes W-S Cooling's spray cooling at the correct temperature and time. Visual charts present data such as wind speed and wind volume, and turn the wind turbine to a strong wind location to optimize power generation.

2.W-S Cooling can establish a database to view temperature, humidity, wind speed and other values ​​in the area, thereby optimizing W-S Cooling operations and maximizing the benefits of cooling and power generation.

### Project development roadmap

The project currently does the following things.

1. Spray cooling protects crops from heat damage

2. PV-Wind hybrid system allows the installation of solar energy without damaging the land

3. The agricultural and electricity symbiosis strategy brings positive benefits to farmers

In the future we plan to...

## Additional details

### How to run the project

Principle application of W-S Cooling
Wind-Solar Complementary Energy Storage System:
By utilizing wind-solar complementary technology, the efficiency and stability of green energy generation are enhanced.  The energy is stored in a storage system for later use.

Wind Tunnel Effect:
The contraction of the wind tunnel reduces air pressure, resulting in increased wind speed, which improves the efficiency of the wind turbines for power generation.

Spray Cooling:
The spray system evaporates water molecules, absorbing environmental heat, effectively cooling the surroundings and creating a refreshing effect.

Manufacturing Method of MOFs:
MOFs can be obtained in batches by homogenizing them through binders or plasticizers and then squeezing and cutting them using an extrusion machine.

Application of Thin-Film Solar Cells:
Using flexible glass to adhere to thin-film solar cells not only extends their lifespan but also facilitates convenient dust cleaning, while reducing manufacturing costs.  Thin-film solar cells can be rolled out like paper and cut into the desired size for mass production.

W-S Cooling adopts the Archimedes spiral fan blade, which has already been applied in existing products, demonstrating its manufacturing feasibility.
